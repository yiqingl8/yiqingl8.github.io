<h2 id="1-introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
<p>“How to succeed” is always the most frequent question every company asks. And we want to help companies answer this question by learning from successful ones. So, we decided to utilize Inc.5000 in 2019, which listed the 5000 Fastest Growing Private Companies in the United States at that year, to figure out the hidden stories based on their data. We hope that our analysis could help people better understand the key factors as well as the common elements a successful company possesses.</p>

<p>The data file comes from <a href="https://data.world/aurielle/inc-5000-2019">INC 5000 - 2019</a> on data.world which is orignially from Inc.com.
We performed a series of data processing and cleaning that can be found in our “Analysis” Jupyter Notebook.</p>

<h2 id="2-one-central-interactive-dashboard-visualization">2. One Central Interactive Dashboard Visualization</h2>

<p>Firstly, we would like to create an interactive dashboard (Fig 1) that reveals precious geographic and monetary information regarding those fastest 5000 companies.</p>

<vegachart schema-url="/assets/json/centraldashboard.json" style="width: 100%"></vegachart>
<center>Fig 1: Central Interactive Dashboard</center>
<p><br /></p>

<p>There are two components in our dashboard. The left part is a heatmap visualization that plots out the company industries and the states they reside. The different color shows the different amount of companies in each combination. 
The chart horizontally shows the business types per state and their count. And looking at the grid vertically can find the distribution of various industries in the United States.</p>

<p>As for the right bar chart, the x-axis is the length that companies have been on the Inc 5000 list, and the y-axis is an aggregate measure of the average revenue. The chart not only shows the financial status of companies but also depicts potential relationships between the revenue and the total time length.</p>

<p>Looking at the dashboard holistically provides great flexibility for people to find different but detailed information based on their needs. For example, people who are only interested in companies in IL and IN can select these two rows, and the bar chart will vary to show the specific performance</p>

<h2 id="3contextual-visualizations">3.Contextual Visualizations</h2>
<p>In addition to the dashboard, we also found other columns in the dataset valuable and researched online to find contextual contents that better serve our topic - helping people understand successful companies.
<br /></p>

<h3 id="31-total-revenue-by-industry">3.1 Total revenue by industry</h3>

<p>One direction we focused on was revenue. By calculating the total revenue based on the industry, we could find the top sectors that make the most money. 
As shown in Fig 2, we can see that Health, Consumer Products &amp; Services, and Construction were the industries with the highest revenue in 2019. And the Health section even made above 38,000 million, which was twice as much as second place. The graph shows us which industries are promising and which ones are not. 
It provides a very good reference for people and entrepreneurs to determine the future direction of their companies.</p>

<p>In this section, we found a treemap visualization created by Gautam Anand<sup>(1)<sup> and</sup></sup></p>
